####   ⚡ Fun fact: 
        - Did you know? The term 'bug' in computer science originated in 1947 when Grace Hopper found an actual moth causing a glitch in the Mark II computer. She removed it and taped it            to the logbook, coining the term 'debugging' for fixing code issues. So, the next time you encounter a bug, just remember, you're following in the footsteps of computer science            history!
